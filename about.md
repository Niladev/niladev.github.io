My name is Nicklas Larsen.

I'm a 25 year old software developer, content creator and wantrepreneur.
This site is my creative outlet where you'll be able to explore ramblings,
short stories, longer stories, blog posts and the like.

Throughout my life I have dabbled with many different industries and areas trying
to find my path but the one thing that has always been persistent is writing.
As such I felt that time had come to establish a place where this writing could
live and breathe. Evolve into something more.

It is my hope that you will join me on this new journey and enjoy it every bit as much
as I do. I will be working hard to give you a reason to keep on following me
and would love to hear your ideas, suggestions or simply chat.
