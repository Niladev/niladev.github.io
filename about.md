My name is Nicklas Larsen, also known as Ququ, and I'm a budding content creator and creative writer.

Ever since I was first exposed to it I've had an interest in esports and with the recent release of Overwatch I decided that time had come to fulfill the dream of becoming involved with esports content creation.

With this site, I want to focus on creating content that leaves you, the reader, more informed than you were before you arrived. To accomplish this, articles published here will mainly cover news, teams, tournaments and the game itself.
What you won't find here are fluff pieces, jokes, satire or the like, not because I don't enjoy that type of content but because I acknowledge that I am terrible at generating it so I'd rather leave it up to people better than me.

You can follow me on various social media to receive notifications on my latest articles as well as on Youtube where I will try to publish bigger articles in video format as well as other video content.

I thank you for taking the time to visit and hope you'll find the content enjoyable!

\-Nicklas "Ququ" Larsen
