# Introduction
Overwatch is the latest installment of Blizzard's games and just so happens to also be their first new intellectual property in 17 years. For this reason, when Blizzard announced the game at Blizzcon in 2014, the hype was almost palpable and up until the release it continued to grow into one of the most hyped game releases ever.

With a lot of games entering the esports scene, Overwatch would be no different and the excitement around the game caused tournaments and teams to pop up before it was even available to the general public.

The focus of this series will be to give you insight into the teams of the current esports scene, their history, the players' history and who they are.



# The team
Reunited is one of the teams that has been groomed for greatness.

Formerly playing as the squad of the Fnatic Battlefield division they were transferred to the Overwatch division once Fnatic decided to shut down their Battlefield division.

<div class="quote">

    "We decided to take that risk and give it a shot. At the moment, there is no real benefit to joining a major organization. Everyone is still trying to figure out how big Overwatch will be. But we are confident that it will be huge. Iâ€™d say, Overwatch is easily the game with the most esports potential this year."

While many would give their right arm to play for an organization like Fnatic, the players only lasted two beta cycles before they decided to break off to create their own organization with full focus on Overwatch citing that there weren't many benefits in being within a major org and that this would be the best time for them to take the risk to start their own.

They wanted to create an organization by players empowered by the community.

While Reunited is currently the best European team, they are known as a team that has good and bad days.

When playing at their full potential, they are contesters for the best team in the world but unfortunately they are plagued with inconsistent play, something that has improved since Overwatch launched officially and hopefully will continue to improve as time goes on.



# The players
The players of Reunited is the squad of the former Fnatic Battlefield team, having several trophies under their belt during their two years with Fnatic.



### Thomas "Morte" Kerbusch

</div>

Thomas Kerbusch, also known as Morte, is one of two support players in Reunited, known for being the stable Mercy player in the team. Being the support player during their time in Battlefield, this is definitely not an unfamiliar role to Morte.

With years in competitive esports, Morte should have plenty of experience to draw from in the Overwatch scene.

Hendrik-William Kinks, also known as Vallutaja, is known for playing McCree and Soldier:76 and plays the offensive role for the team. With a diverse champion pool, Vallutaja is able to fit offensive heroes to the team's need.

During his competitive experience, his role was very much a flex pick for the team, a role that he has continued to fill as they've been working they way into the Overwatch scene.

Eric van Hoorn, also known as 2Easy, is known for his Widowmaker and Tracer with an incredible aim, making it possible for his team to push points with ease as he clears the backline either sniping or flanking. Vallutaja and 2Easy's ability to flex pick offensive heroes allows the team to create an offensive line that allows for maximum takedowns.

2Easy has been playing shooters since a very young age and has been playing in the competitive scene for multiple years.

Andrei Leonov, also known as uNFixed, is the flex player of the Reunited roster. Mostly flexing between offensive heroes such as Pharah or Genji, uNFixed will pick whatever is needed to make the team composition fit together.

As his teammates, uNFixed has plenty of competitive experience to carry over into the Overwatch scene.

Sergi Torras, also known as Winghaven, is the pillar in the Reunited team, the tank that allows the team to push forward on control points and payloads. With a very fluid champion pool, Winghaven utilizes whatever tank heroes allows him to get the objective done and is not afraid to switch during matches.

Winghaven is also amongst the Reunited players with former Battlefield experience.

# Closing
Reunited is definitely stacked with a talented roster, however, their success will depend on whether they fix their inconsistent performance. Their synergy seems to be on point, allowing them to act as a single unit when playing at their best.

The next team in the series will be **EnVyUs**, a European team that was flown to North America, given a gaming house and nearly infinite resources, looking to be a very strong contender for the best team in the world.
