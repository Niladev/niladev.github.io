# Introduction

Overwatch is the latest installment of Blizzard's games and just so happens to also be their first new intellectual property in 17 years. For this reason, when Blizzard announced the game at Blizzcon in 2014, the hype was almost palpable and up until the release it continued to grow into one of the most hyped game releases ever.

With a lot of games entering the esports scene, Overwatch would be no different and the excitement around the game caused tournaments and teams to pop up before it was even available to the general public.

The focus of this series will be to give you insight into the teams of the current esports scene, their history, the players' history and who they are.

# The team

To start the series off we're going to be looking into the number one team in globally, Cloud9.
Although the team didn't sign with C9 until around March 9th, the team has been a dominant force since February, maintaining largely the same roster since December.

Formerly known as "S A D B O Y S 2001", "soda can", and "google me" the team had their start in December in the second Gosugamers weekly tournament where they reached the semi-finals before making their exit.

</p>

With Kyky, Reaver, deBett, Surefour and Adam as the stable points of the team, they started gaining traction in early March where they won their first tournament and picked up Grego after which they continued to dominate the next weekly tournament. In the winner's interview after the tournament, Kyky hinted that something was in the works regarding sponsors and partners. Two days later, on the 9th of March, Cloud 9 announced their pickup of the team citing the impressive results of the team as the reason.

The C9 squad is known for pioneering strategies such as the 2/2/2 comps using double Winstons, double Lucio and double McCree/Tracers as well as other dominant combinations. They are a team who's quick at adapting to the new meta whenever a patch is released. This is in part due to their strict practice regiment but also their relaxed attitude towards their scrims, allowing themselves to try out crazy things, experimenting with different heroes.

As part of the Cloud 9 organisation, the team has continued on an impressive streak of wins losing only one match, according to GosuGamers, since April clinching their spot as the number one team globally.

# The players

The roster of C9 is a diverse mix of FPS and MMO players, some of which have played competitively with others who are
relatively new to the esports scene.

# Closing

It is quite clear that the synergy between these guys is high, they've been playing together for months and
only seem to get better with each tournament. They are consistent, ahead of the curve and have fun while doing it.

The next team in the series will be **REUNITED** from Europe who have proven themselves to be a definite contender even without the backing of a large organization.
