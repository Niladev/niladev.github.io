Before you read this, I want you to close your eyes and travel to the back of your head. While your mind is travelling there, are there any small thoughts, dreams or considerations trying to grab your attention? Depending on who you are, they’re either glaringly obvious, or cautiously trying to poke you along the way. Either way, most of us just stuff them back in their little dark corner of our mind until we feel like we can handle pursuing or listening to them.


That’s what I’ve been doing for most of my life. My hopes and dreams weren’t realistic, not achievable or sustainable, is what I told myself every time they appeared up from their prison. I want to be a writer, and to live some place other than Denmark. When I looked at how to achieve this growing up, somehow my mind always told me that it wasn’t possible. That I needed to build a career, start my own company, make a lot of money and then, but only then could I pursue my dreams. Anything earlier than that would only lead my life to a total failure.

If you’re reading this, I bet you’re doing something along the same lines. Much like myself, you’ve convinced yourself that what you’re doing now is bearable because at some point it will allow you to shift focus to what you want.
Well, I’m here to tell you that you’re wasting the best years of your life in the hopes that it will somehow, by magic , make your dreams come true.


If you don’t follow them, they’ll never happen. You’ll never find a better time than right now to take the chance and jump into the abyss. It won’t be pretty, it most likely won’t be comfortable, but it’s the only way you’ll achieve what you’re really meant to do. The beauty of it is that once you make that jump, you’ll see doors open that you never thought possible because you’ll be working towards it even when you think you’re not.


I recently decided to take the leap. I always wanted to live in another country, so I decided to travel to some of the countries I had considered. One was Norway which resembled Denmark a bit too much for me to feel like I had actually gone anywhere, and the other was Spain. I’m currently sitting in the plane on my way home from Spain. I had nothing planned going down there other than to visit what little family I had and look around for plausible ways to move there.


Little did I know that even without any plans I would end up landing a job that would help me get all paperwork sorted and multiple living arrangements for the first period.

    The people around you feel your passion, they’re inspired by it and will do what they can to help you keep it alive.
</div>

How did that happen? Some would say that I was lucky to be at the right place at the right time but quite frankly I think that’s bullshit. When you want something, when you truly want it to the point where you can feel it in your bones, you’re a completely different person. You can’t help talking about it because you’re so excited, it’s filling you up to the point of overflowing, spilling into the people around you, the people you talk to, spend your time with.


Passion like that can’t be ignored, and I guarantee you that if they can help you in any way, they’ll want to. It’s inspiring to see people like that. I know, because I meet them every day, and I do everything I can to help them just like the wonderful people who met me during my vacation helped me.


I’m not trying to say that everything will just be a cakewalk from then on and that you’ll never have to work a day in your life. I worked my ass off during my vacation to try and get this to succeed. Instead what I am trying to say is that if you do decide to follow what really ignites your fire, it won’t feel like work. It will feel like you’re becoming the person you were always meant to be. You’ll want to work your ass off, make sacrifices, do whatever it takes to make it happen and in the end, no matter the result, you’ll know that you gave it everything and that you have nothing to regret.


It is possible to allow yourself to flow in the right direction, relinquish control and slowly feel yourself drift towards the people who share your interests, people who can help you, people you can help. Instead working against the stream you’re working with it and things will feel easier, more manageable, maybe even easy at times.


What I’m trying to say with all this, if I am trying to say anything at all is that what’s the risk? What do you really have to lose? If you try and succeed, great! If you try and figure out it wasn’t all it was cracked up to be, you’ve grown as a person, and I’m sure you found something along the way that’ll make your next journey even better. Should you happen to go through an entire life, chasing your dream but come up empty, write me and tell me how wrong I was, but I am quite confident that it won’t come that far.
