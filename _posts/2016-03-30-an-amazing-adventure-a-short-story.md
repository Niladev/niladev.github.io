He looked around, surrounded by his friend as they enjoyed the view. Today was a good day, he could feel it. The day he’d been waiting for, pushing for. He’d just have to wiggle a bit more and it would be his turn, his turn to explore the beautiful world that had laid before him since he was born.


He looked at his friends, some were larger, some were smaller but it didn’t matter. They would explore the world together! Even Larry at the end who’d looked a bit sick lately. He readied his voice and gave the command and they began pushing and shoving.
Before they knew it, it had happened. They were free, the adventure had begun and they were now rushing towards new and unknown territories. Places they had only seen from afar, creatures they’d only heard fairytales of and a new home amongst new and exciting friends.


The landing had been quite rough but they had managed. Larry had gotten separated from them but not to worry, he would probably catch up later once he’d recovered. Their next journey began and if he had to say it, it hadn’t been as luxurious and exciting as people had been telling the stories, not yet anyway.


It had been a rough couple of days but it could only go up from here. Larry hadn’t come back yet but he could still make it although their room had been quite small it hadn’t seemed like they had moved a lot. Next time he was definitely upgrading their tickets, they had been stuck between at least a thousand other passengers and he was happy he’d been in the middle. He couldn’t imagine the guys on the sides, they must’ve been crushed.


The next time he woke they had apparently arrived because they were all sitting on a balcony. The view was kind of horrible, and the sun wasn’t nearly as warm as it used to be. Now that he looked more closely there also seemed to quite a lot of them, he’d only ever seen one at home. All of that was quickly forgotten when he saw the creatures walked past him. One of them was moving straight towards them. They seemed a lot larger. A lot larger! It picked them up and dropped them.
It seemed a bit rough but at least, they had been the only travelers this time. He’d have to talk to the agency when he figured out who they were. Now they were sat in what appeared to be a see-through barrier. This place also had multiple suns but these were warmer than the former place.


Another one of the creatures moved towards them, much smaller than the others but it seemed to be very interested in them. It hovered over them for a bit before one of its claws moved towards him. It grabbed a hold of him and before he knew it, it ripped him from the others. He looked down at his friends as he moved towards the little creature.
As the boy took a bite of the banana, his mother looked at him.
“Oh Jonathan, we’re having dinner in less than an hour. You won’t be able to eat anything!” and they both laughed as he threw the rest of it out.
