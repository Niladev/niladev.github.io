I recently came to the conclusion that I might be too overwhelmed by all the choices I have presented for me. I am currently working as a computer scientist, but should I continue in my startup? Should I go freelance? Work for a big corporation? What if I don’t even want to do computer science, what if I wanted to pursue my passion for writing? Do I even know what I want to do?


These are some of the questions that I have been repeatedly asked myself every day ever since I made the decision to take a degree as computer scientist. A choice I made because it was something I enjoyed, was decent at, and had a high opportunity for personal and financial growth at a rapid pace.

Now, I’ve been working as a full stack developer for the past 8 months for a startup. I am pretty sure that if I want to continue as a developer, I will never find a workplace better than this. I love the people that surround me every day, I love the work I do, I believe in our product and by all means it looks like it will succeed.


Yet I still find myself doubting whether I actually want to continue as a developer. It feels like the puzzle piece that fits where you put it, but somehow the image doesn’t quite look right. Despite what seems to be a perfect fit, something still seems a bit off. This might just be me adjusting to the working life of course however…


Because of these feelings I made a decision. I needed to get away from everything for a while. Disconnect. To do this I have asked my boss for a holiday in March where I will be walking somewhere between 200 and 400 km (depending on how well I do) in 6 days. 6 days where I will be completely disconnected from the world, living in a tent or whatever inns/hostels I can find nearby.


But is it worth it? Will it actually connect me with my inner self? Is the journey too short to really reconnect? Are there alternatives to achieve the same goal? These answers wouldn’t affect my decision, but I am very interested in your opinion on this. Do you have an experience? Did you almost do the same? Have you done the same? Did you regret never doing it? Did you achieve the same goal with different means?


I’d love to hear suggestions, advice, stories, comforting words that tell me that it will be a piece of cake, and horrible reality telling me that I will likely destroy my body and mind. Whatever you feel like sharing!
