# Liberated
Last week I wrote a post telling you how you should stop suffering and start following your dreams instead. I wrote that post because I myself finally had had enough. For too long I had been suffering from logical decisions that had made me follow a path that I didn’t actual care for. I felt absolutely liberated as if someone had cleaned the window inside my mind and suddenly I could actually see the real world through my eyes.

I want to be a writer. I am going to become a writer. It won’t happen overnight and there is no doubt that I have oceans of knowledge still to absorb but I there is no doubt in my mind that I am going to become a writer. It feels incredible to be able to say that. To be able to say that despite any obstacles the one clear thing in my head is that it is going to happen.

My world view has become brighter and I feel energised to take on the world in a whole new capacity. I want to shine so bright that you can’t help but be inspired. With this new world view, I made two of the biggest life-changing decisions I’ve ever made.
Not only am I replacing my job with one that is less demanding, giving me more free time to focus on my writing but I am also moving to another country. I want to forge the person who can become the writer I so desire to be, I want to rid myself of past excuses so that I can charge forward, put myself in untested waters where the surroundings don’t know who or what I am.

# Terrified
All this dreaming is very nice. It’s nice to think that I’ll be able to uproot my entire life, leave my family behind and follow my dreams but I’m terrified.

I wish I could ignore the voices of failure who’s constantly whispering in my ear. As Matthew Trinetti wrote in his post This is how you write they’re always there, they mock you and do everything in their power to make you give up so that they can get even more ammunition to fire at you.

Defeating these voices or just being able to continue with them constantly at your side, judging everything you do, buckets of water ready to put out whatever small spark of inspiration might arise seems like an impossible task.
I am going to be a writer I say but reality is that there are millions in the world saying the exact same thing. How am I going to stand out? What could I do to be among the triumphant victors? That’s what terrifies me the most. I don’t know. I am so afraid to disappoint you that I throw the first bucket of water myself. I constantly think about what I can’t offer you instead of trying to figure out what I could offer.

My entire life, those voices have discouraged me from following my dream and what’s to say they won’t succeed this time as well? That’s the sentence I repeat in my head every time I sit down and stare at the blank paper.
What differs, this time, is that I am terrified, but I still continue, I still push through even if they manage to hide the inspiration from me.

This quote stuck with me. Inspired me and gives me courage whenever I feel that the voices are about to take over. Thanks to this quote and articles posted all over Medium, filled with inspiration in all different shapes I continue onward. This inspiration has given me the resolution to challenge myself.

Challenge myself to give it my all. I want to write every day, to sit down when my inspiration is at the lowest and still fill the blank page with words.

I want to surround myself with a thousand people who read my work, inspire me, criticise me, encourage me and to whom I can give back to, feel a sense of responsibility to, produce great content for and I want you to be one of them.

That sentence came awfully close to a sales pitch from a telemarketer and I apologise for that but only a little. In reality, I do want to sell myself to you and I want you to give me a chance, help me grow and hopefully, I’ll be able to give you interesting content in return.
